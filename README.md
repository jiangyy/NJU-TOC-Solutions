# The Unofficial Solutions Manual of "Introduction to Models of Computation"

This is the solutions to the book "Introduction to Models of Computation" by Prof. Fangmin Song. This textbook used in the graduate-level course at Nanjing University, and we hope this solutions manual will be useful to everyone attending this course.

If you are intended to improve our solutions, you can either fork a repository and notify me to pull your fork, or just post an issue. If you are making large revisions, a pull request is more plausible. On the other hand, if you are making small changes and feel inconvenient modifying the code, simply post an "issue" and the authors will resolve it. Any kind of improvements are welcomed: spell corrections, better solutions, challenges to proof, to name but a few. All contributors will be archived in the Credits section.

You may "watch" this project to see its current progress.

# Update List
